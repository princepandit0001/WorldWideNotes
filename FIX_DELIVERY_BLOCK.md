# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Fix Cloudinary "Blocked for delivery" Issue

## Problem
Your uploaded files show **"Blocked for delivery"** which prevents downloads and viewing.
Error: `401 Unauthorized` when trying to access files.

## Quick Fix Steps:

### Method 1: Enable Public Access (Recommended)
1. **Go to Cloudinary Dashboard**: https://cloudinary.com
2. **Login** to your account (dpfrv7kmo)
3. **Go to Settings** â†’ **Security**
4. **Find "Secure delivery"** section
5. **Turn OFF** "Restrict media delivery" 
6. **Save** settings

### Method 2: Update Upload Preset Settings
1. **Go to Settings** â†’ **Upload**
2. **Find your preset**: `wwnotespreset`
3. **Edit the preset**
4. **Set "Access control"** to **"Public"**
5. **Enable "Allow public access"**
6. **Save** changes

### Method 3: Asset-Level Fix
1. **Go to Media Library**
2. **Find your uploaded file**: `world-wide-notes/yzs8gnn723ayz8noogkw`
3. **Click on the file**
4. **In the right panel**, find **"Access Control"**
5. **Change from "Blocked for delivery"** to **"Public"**
6. **Save**

## Alternative: Use Signed URLs (Advanced)
If you want to keep files private but allow downloads, you can use signed URLs. This requires updating the code to generate signed URLs with your API secret.

## Test After Changes
1. Wait 2-3 minutes for changes to propagate
2. Refresh your website
3. Try downloading/viewing the uploaded file
4. Check browser console for any remaining errors

## Expected Result
- Files should download successfully
- View online should open files in new tab
- No more 401 errors in console

## Still Having Issues?
If problems persist:
1. Try uploading a new file after making these changes
2. Check that your account is not on a restricted plan
3. Verify your upload preset is set to "unsigned" mode

**IMPORTANT**: The "Blocked for delivery" setting is a security feature. Make sure you're comfortable with making your files publicly accessible before changing this setting.
