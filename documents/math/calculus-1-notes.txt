# Sample Mathematics Notes - Calculus I

## Chapter 1: Limits and Derivatives

### 1.1 Introduction to Limits

A limit describes the behavior of a function as its input approaches a particular value.

**Definition**: The limit of f(x) as x approaches a is L, written as:

lim (x→a) f(x) = L

### 1.2 Basic Limit Properties

1. **Constant Rule**: lim (x→a) c = c
2. **Identity Rule**: lim (x→a) x = a  
3. **Sum Rule**: lim (x→a) [f(x) + g(x)] = lim (x→a) f(x) + lim (x→a) g(x)

### 1.3 Derivatives

The derivative of a function represents its rate of change at any given point.

**Definition**: f'(x) = lim (h→0) [f(x+h) - f(x)]/h

### Common Derivatives:
- d/dx (x^n) = nx^(n-1)
- d/dx (sin x) = cos x
- d/dx (cos x) = -sin x
- d/dx (e^x) = e^x

### Practice Problems:

1. Find lim (x→2) (x² - 4)/(x - 2)
2. Calculate f'(x) if f(x) = 3x² + 2x - 1
3. Determine the slope of y = x³ at x = 2
